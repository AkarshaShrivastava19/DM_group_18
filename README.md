This report outlines the creation of our Database Management System (DBMS) for an e-commerce firm located in the UK, beginning with the development of a schema defining the structure and organization of our database. 

Our process involved four main steps: Business requirement Analysis to align database needs with business objectives, Conceptual Database Design with E-R modelling, Logical Database Design translating E-R model into relational database tables, and Physical Database Design determining storage mechanisms and efficient data access methods. Finally, advanced data analysis is used to analyse the current state of the company and growth index. 

These steps ensure a robust foundation for our digital infrastructure, supporting seamless data management aligned with business goals.
